When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  when working with a group on the same project or when i want to share my project with others.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
	because i want to update my local version when i finish my changes to it.
