How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It compared both files in a second with this command: fc game_old.js game_new.js

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    I will spot the bug easier and faster.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Pros: I will save the versions according to what i see .. Cons: Not everything will be saved if i forgot
	
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    It is more useful and much easier to track all the affected files at some point rather than tracking them individually.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log /git log --stat: will show all the commits in this repo .. git diff [first-commit] [second-commit]: will show the diffs

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because all the version will be saved if i changed my mind back and i can easily get back to the older versions.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
